/// A MusicBrainz release represents the unique release (i.e. issuing) of a product on a specific
/// date with specific release information such as the country, label, barcode and packaging.
/// If you walk into a store and purchase an album or single, they are each represented in
/// MusicBrainz as one release.
///
/// Each release belongs to a release group and contains at least one medium (commonly referred to
/// as a disc when talking about a CD release). Each medium has a tracklist.
/// A medium is the actual physical medium that stores the audio content. This means that each CD
/// in a multi-disc release will be entered as separate mediums within the release, and that both
/// sides of a vinyl record or cassette will exist on one medium. Mediums have a format (e.g. CD,
/// DVD, vinyl, and cassette) and can optionally also have a title. Sometimes a medium can be a
/// side of a disc. For example, the two sides of a hybrid SACD (the CD side and the SACD side)
/// should be entered as two mediums.
/// Tracklists represent the set and ordering of tracks as listed on a liner, and the same tracklist
/// can appear on more than one release. For example, a boxset compilation that contains previously
/// released CDs would share the same tracklists as the separate releases.
